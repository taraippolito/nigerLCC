Repo for all code used for the Land Use Suitability Analysis for Decision Making in Niger project - Sustainability Innovation Lab University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Dr. Jason Neff

Code folder includes code for all steps of the research project - look at the INFO_ON_FILES document to see the breakdown of which code was used in each step of the process. Jupyter notebooks were used for all .ipynb files, Pycharm was used for all .py files. 

NOTE** In order to use much of the code, an ArcGis python 2.7 interpreter is needed.
